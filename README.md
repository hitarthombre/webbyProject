# 🍽️ Webby – Smart Dining & Event Planning App

**Webby** is a third-year academic project that aims to revolutionize dining and event planning through an all-in-one platform. Designed with both diners and restaurant owners in mind, Webby simplifies restaurant discovery, table booking, personalized food recommendations, and banquet/event planning.

The project is divided into two repositories:
